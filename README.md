Write algorithms step by step for UNNC course, Introduction to Data Science (BUSI3122)

Hello, everyone. 

For learning algorithms in this course, I've built a open source project in Github for all of us to learn how to write algorithm step byu step in Python. The url is: https://github.com/Crayon-ShinChan/ids-algorithms

Let's learn IDS together in a practical way. It will be very nice if you can contribute your knowledge and code for this open source project.

## What is the detail about the project
This project will give some explainations of machine learning algorithms and use pure python to implement them.

What you'll see and learn including
1. algorithm principle and explaintion 
2. data processing and visualization (use Python)
3. some useful notes and knowledge that lecture slides don't give

## What should you prepare for this project:
For people who just want to learn:
1. Install Anaconda in your computer, Anaconda is an out-of-the-box tool to help you start running and writing Python
2. Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, then you can use jupyter file to learn

For people who want to contribute to this open source project:
1. Learn Git and Github, so you can contribute your code

## What should you do when you get stuck:
1. Google your problems
2. Python code problems, read related content in this book "Python for Data Analysis": https://b-ok.global/book/1306441/a4c459
3. Machine learning algorithm problems, read 《统计学习方法》by 李航

## Reference of this project
1. IDS Lecture slides
2. 统计学习方法
